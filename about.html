                <h2 class="section-heading">How It All Started</h2>
                
                <p>I grew up in the remote part of Nigeria, where fetching water from distant rivers was a norm for my siblings and me. We would journey for kilometers just to collect water that did not meet potable quality. But in those moments, our focus wasn’t on quality—just survival. That early experience planted a seed in me, one that has since grown into a passion for water resource management and the desire to make water available to everyone, especially those like us, who’ve known scarcity up close.</p>
                
                <p>My interest in water soon connected me to a larger mission—food security. I can’t bear the thought of a world where millions still go to bed hungry. If we’re going to end hunger once and for all, I believe the key lies in embracing agriculture, particularly at the nexus of water and food. This belief drives me every day as I strive to contribute to sustainable solutions in the water-agriculture-food continuum.</p>

                <p>With the global population projected to reach 10.5 billion by 2100, I want to be part of the generation that ensures everyone is fed. I want posterity to remember me as someone who helped sow the seeds of ease and abundance, contributing to a world where food insecurity is a thing of the past.</p>

                <p>Throughout my journey, I’ve cultivated a deep interest in spatial data science, and in 2020, I was honored to be among the grand finalists of the 'Farming by Satellite Prize'. I also earned a Master’s degree in Agricultural Water Management Engineering from the prestigious University of Debrecen, finishing in the top 1% of my class. Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Iowa State University, working under the esteemed Professor Amy Kaleita in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering. My research centers on modeling ecosystem services in perennial ground cover systems, and right now, I’m focused on soil erosion modeling—just one piece of a much larger puzzle I’m excited to solve.</p>

                <p>Outside the lab, I enjoy volunteering, meeting new people, and offering guidance to those seeking clarity in their journeys. I’m also a lover of edifying music and an avid reader. Wherever life takes me, you’ll likely find me in a public library, even though my home is filled with books. There’s something about the quiet expanse of a library that feeds my curiosity and passion for learning.</p>
